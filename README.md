While only the .au3 file is approved, use the executable at your own risk.

11. Next adjust the Color Settings to suit your image, **Threshold is used to remove parts of the image that fall within a specified color range.** (Using Colors takes a lot longer to process due to the color comparission, if you just want to draw with black, dont enable any colors)
